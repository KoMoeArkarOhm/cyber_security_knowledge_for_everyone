### 1. Implementation flaw
 We are faced with a common programming mistake, which is not considering all possible wrong inputs from the user.
### 2. Design flaw 
 The design of the system allows theft. There should have been an authentication phase implemented within the system.
### 3. Operation flaw 
 As a system designer you need to make sure you can receive actual authentication, when one is required. Always account for possible social engineering methods.
