## Exercise 1.1

Your favourite pizza place launched a new, innovative delivery system in collaboration with the local phone companies. All you have to do is input your phone number, and it will use your phone's geolocation to figure out where you are, deliver your pizza there and charge you on your phone bill! You noticed that if you input an empty phone number, the system crashes.

What sort of vulnerability might that be?
- Design flaw
- Implementation flaw
- Operation flaw 



## Exercise 1.2

The bug was fixed, but you figured you can input your neighbour's phone number, and just meet the delivery guy downstairs â€“ so you get the pizza, and your neighbour gets the bill.

What sort of vulnerability is that?
- Design flaw
- Implementation flaw
- Operation flaw 

## Exercise 1.3

To fight such trickery, the pizza company issued a policy that requires delivery men to call customers upon arrival. So the next time, just before the delivery guy arrived, you asked your neighbour to borrow his phone (because yours just died and you need to make a quick call urgently). You then used it to prove you are indeed the rightfully-billed customer.
